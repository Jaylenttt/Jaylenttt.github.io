### Welcome!

Theoretical physics is a branch of physics that focuses on the development of mathematical models and theories to understand and explain natural phenomena.
It plays a crucial role in our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe and the fundamental particles that make up all matter.
Research in theoretical physics helps us to make predictions about how the universe works and to test these predictions through experiments.
It also helps us to understand the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy, and to explore the limits of our current knowledge.
Theoretical physics helps us to make progress in a wide range of fields, including cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, and it has led to many important discoveries and technological innovations.

### Research Topics: 

Research in the laboratory focuses on 6 core topics: 
(1) Efficient Machine Learning 
(2) Mathematical Theory for Deep Learning 
(3) Big Data Analytics/Processing 
(4) High-Performance Computing 
(5) Architecting Hardware Accelerator 
(6) AI in Health

### For Prospective Students/Scholars: 

The Intelligent computing research lab is looking for self-motivated students and scholars to join the Lab for pursuing graduate degrees (M.S. in Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Mathematics and/or Computer Science and Ph.D. in Computational Science) or conduct collaborative research. Also, there are multiple visiting scholar positions. If you are interested in working with me, please send your resume to ybai2 at uci dot edu.
